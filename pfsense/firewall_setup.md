This guide documents the configuration of pfSense in a virtual lab environment. Installasjon er tatt til siden og ikke vurdert som del av prosess

### 1. Network Setup in VMWare
pfSense requires at least two network adapters:

* WAN: Connected to NAT, which provides internet access
  
* LAN: Connected to an internal communication
  
  1. Open VM Settings -> Click 'Add' and choose 'Network Adapter'. This creates a new adapter
 
  2. New adapter: Change network connection to custom -> select vmnet2 or any other internal network

  3. Start VM ðŸ‘¹

    
### 2.  pfSense Interface Configuration
  1. As showcased in the image below, both network adapters are successfully recognized by pfSense.
     
     vmware assigns adapters in order, so with this in mind we can assume em0 is NAT.

     An identical GUI will appear for LAN, we proceed by assigning the remaining adapter which is em1

  2. Likewise for LAN, we will assign the remaining adapter which is em1.
    
     As a result we have now been successfully given a static ip within a /24 CIDR subnet. DHCP will then assign dynamic ip adresses to clients between 192.168.1.100 to x.x.x.150

  3. Spam continue through the prompts until you reach a confirmation screen to delete virutal disk. Press yes. Select the newest version and its done!
