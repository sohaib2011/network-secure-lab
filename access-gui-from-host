1. Since my Ubuntu Server runs in terminal-mode, and lynx is insufficient for the full access of pfsense interface, we need proper GUI access to pfSense.

The best approach for this would be to access the web interface from host

2. In VMware Workstatin, go to Edit -> Virtual Network Editor

3. Select the internal network pfSense LAN is using, which in my case is vmnet2

4. Make sure the network type is set to host-only and apply the change
